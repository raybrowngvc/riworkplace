										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearing the end of an office lease is a bit like reaching a fork in the road for your company&#8217;s future. And for CEOs, CHROs and Facility Managers, making the right choice and ensuring everything goes smoothly requires careful planning and strategic decision-making.<br />
With 30+ years’ experience designing and building workspaces in Manhattan, and throughout the Greater New York City area, we have our fair share of experience in this area. We’ve also been asked for advice on this subject quite a lot lately, so we thought we’d put together a comprehensive guide for you.<br />
Read on for our seven essential steps for successfully navigating a lease expiration.</p>
<h2>1. Be the early birds that get the worm</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early assessment is key for navigating a commercial lease expiration, and we advise all our clients to begin the process well in advance. Early assessment allows you to evaluate your current space, observe where it works well (or where it doesn’t) to evaluate your firm’s evolving needs, as well as the impact of remote and hybrid work arrangements, and then determine whether renegotiation &#8211; or indeed, a relocation &#8211; is your next best step.</span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133937" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Woman-working-in-board-room-on-tablet.jpg" alt="Woman working in boardroom on tablet" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Woman-working-in-board-room-on-tablet.jpg 1080w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Woman-working-in-board-room-on-tablet-300x200.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Woman-working-in-board-room-on-tablet-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Woman-working-in-board-room-on-tablet-768x512.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Woman-working-in-board-room-on-tablet-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<h2><b>2. Get your dream team together</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a team together that includes members from your company’s various departments &#8211; ops, finance, HR, facilities, marketing, etc &#8211;  and get their input on what works well for them and what else they need from their working environment. This will provide a comprehensive overview and help you to address specific needs related to space requirements, employee preferences, and budget constraints.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133938" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Team-collaborating-at-office-high-bench-.jpeg" alt="Happy team discussing workspace environment in a modern office" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Team-collaborating-at-office-high-bench-.jpeg 1080w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Team-collaborating-at-office-high-bench--300x200.jpeg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Team-collaborating-at-office-high-bench--1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Team-collaborating-at-office-high-bench--768x512.jpeg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Team-collaborating-at-office-high-bench--700x467.jpeg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<h2><b>3. Ask the design/build experts on board</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a design/build team’s knowledge on office space and what you can/can’t do in regards to space planning, it’s important to consult a team of designers/builders *prior* to negotiate your lease to confirm you’re making the best decision for your company. A design/build firm’s expertise will help you transform your new space into an efficient, inspiring and future-ready environment. Professional designers will show you how a new, attractive, well-functioning, tech-integrated workspace is essential for communicating your company&#8217;s culture and goals, and boosting your bottom line.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133939" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3D-render-of-office-space.png" alt="" width="1080" height="849" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3D-render-of-office-space.png 1080w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3D-render-of-office-space-300x236.png 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3D-render-of-office-space-1024x805.png 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3D-render-of-office-space-768x604.png 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3D-render-of-office-space-700x550.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<h2><b>4. Analyze the space</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time to conduct a detailed analysis of your space requirements. Consider factors such as employee headcount, departmental needs, and future growth projections. This analysis will help guide your decisions on the size and layout of the space you need.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-130656" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/20-Waterview-Blvd-7-1.jpg" alt="Modern hybrid office space" width="1079" height="726" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/20-Waterview-Blvd-7-1.jpg 1990w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/20-Waterview-Blvd-7-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/20-Waterview-Blvd-7-1-1024x688.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/20-Waterview-Blvd-7-1-768x516.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/20-Waterview-Blvd-7-1-1536x1033.jpg 1536w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/20-Waterview-Blvd-7-1-700x471.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1079px) 100vw, 1079px" /></p>
<h2><b>5. Get your financial plan sorted</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will need to develop a realistic budget that includes the cost of the new lease *and* expenses related to relocation, build-out, and potential downtime, if that’s the path you wish to take. Getting a tight financial strategy in place at this point will help your firm to stay financially stable during the transition.</span></p>
<h2><b>6. Time to negotiate</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you choose to renew or relocate, negotiating favorable lease terms should be number one on your priorities list. Enlist the services of recommended legal and real estate professionals to work with your design/builder and ensure the terms align with your company&#8217;s long-term goals, protect your interests, and most importantly do not lock you in to using the landlord’s architect or contractor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every lease negotiation includes a tenant improvement (TI) allowance. Make sure that this is money made available to you to pay your chosen design/builder, not money paid to the landlord’s architect and contractor who are not necessarily working for your best interests. Don&#8217;t let the fox be in charge of the chicken coop.</span></p>
<h2><b> </b><b>7. Plan for a seamless transition</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’re ready to embark on the next step, make sure ‘minimize disruption to operations’ is at the top of your to-do list. How? Keep your people informed and in the loop throughout the whole process, addressing any concerns they might have along the way, and communicating the benefits of the upcoming changes whenever possible. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A transition with excellent communication flows more smoothly, leading to a positive team fully on board with your plans.</span></p>
<h3><b>To sum up…</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope our blog has given you food for thought and comes in helpful if you and your company are currently on the cusp of a lease expiration. We’re also here to take some of the heavy lifting off your hands if you are.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So let’s start with the obvious question…</p>
<h2>What is a hybrid office?</h2>
<p>We here at RI Workplace could write a book on it, but we’re going to keep it short and sweet!<br />
A hybrid office is one that caters to employees who mix remote with on-site work &#8211; and it’s one that feels like home to employees whether they work full-time in the office or just a couple days a week.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-15952" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RI-Group-4.jpg" alt="Office Reception with library" width="1080" height="675" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RI-Group-4.jpg 1280w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RI-Group-4-300x188.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RI-Group-4-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RI-Group-4-768x480.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RI-Group-4-700x438.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a flexible workspace that captures the team spirit of a traditional Mon-Fri/9-5 office while giving employees the best of both worlds &#8211; fostering teamwork and connection, whether they’re in the office or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously the trend for hybrid work exploded as a result of the pandemic, but even with the global lockdown fortunately now a distant memory, there are no signs of the preference for hybrid working coming to an end. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, recent data suggests that a whopping </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/remote-work-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">98% of US office workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want to work remotely at least some of the time. Creating a workplace to match should be top of every CEO’s to-do list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at how to create a successful hybrid workplace starting with…</span></p>
<h2>5 key hybrid work trends CEOs must consider</h2>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Flexibility and autonomy is the name of the game. </span>Today’s employees want a better work/life balance and want to choose where they work from. Simple as that.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: left;" start="2">
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Advanced technology integration is essential. </span>To facilitate this, CEOs need the digital tools and collaborative platforms that enable effective communication and collaboration. This is where a deep-dive to the area with your CTO and IT team comes in!</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-133379" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Communal-Office-Space-with-sound-dampening-.jpg" alt="Communal Office Space with sound dampening" width="1081" height="720" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Communal-Office-Space-with-sound-dampening-.jpg 1080w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Communal-Office-Space-with-sound-dampening--300x200.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Communal-Office-Space-with-sound-dampening--1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Communal-Office-Space-with-sound-dampening--768x512.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Communal-Office-Space-with-sound-dampening--700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1081px) 100vw, 1081px" /></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Employee wellbeing and mental health support should be offered. </span>In 2024, more companies than ever are focusing on mental wellbeing initiatives in recognition of the main challenges remote workers face, for example feeling isolated, disconnected, or under pressure to work more hours.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Skill development and lifelong learning is important to hybrid workers. </span>There’s an upwards swing in individuals proactively seeking external learning and upskilling opportunities to stay competitive in the fast-moving hybrid landscape.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Work-life integration must be considered. </span>There’s been a move from work-life balance to work-life integration, so CEOs also need to help employers navigate the professional aspects of work in their personal space.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these key holistic considerations in place, companies then need to look at the design of their workspace and how this plays a key part in delivering on all of the above. Which brings us to…</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-131596" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reasons-why-an-office-refresh-is-a-great-idea.jpg" alt="Renovated Kitchen and Cafeteria Area with branded colors" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reasons-why-an-office-refresh-is-a-great-idea.jpg 1280w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reasons-why-an-office-refresh-is-a-great-idea-300x200.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reasons-why-an-office-refresh-is-a-great-idea-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reasons-why-an-office-refresh-is-a-great-idea-768x512.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reasons-why-an-office-refresh-is-a-great-idea-700x466.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<h2>10 ways CEOs can adapt their office to cater to the new hybrid workforce</h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deliver flexible workspace layouts: it’s a no-brainer, offices with adaptable layouts that accommodate various workstyles, allowing for both collaborative and focused work are key.
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide home office ergonomics: companies providing support for home office setups &#8211; including ergonomic furniture and technology, to ensure the comfort and productivity of remote workers &#8211; are the kind of companies top talent flock to.
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitate hybrid meeting solutions: As discussed previously, incorporating technology for seamless virtual and in-person meetings &#8211; ensuring an inclusive experience for both remote and on-site participants is essential.
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider wellness-centric design: Integrating elements of biophilic design, ample natural light, and wellness spaces within the office will naturally support employee health, wellbeing and productivity.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<p></span><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130513" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4.jpg" alt="A multi-purpose area of office that efficiently handle the needs of their growing team" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4.jpg 1280w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4-700x466.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update your technology infrastructure: Next-level tech to facilitate next-level collaboration requires CEOs to invest in next-level IT infrastructure to support it &#8211; including robust cybersecurity measures and high-speed internet access.
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide employee-centric amenities: these include amenities such as on-site childcare facilities and wellness programs to enhance the overall employee experience.
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aim for sustainable and green design: emphasizing environmentally-conscious design principles shows you care about the world and your workforce. The new generation of talent expects nothing less.
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage personalized workstations: allow employees to personalize their workspaces, whether at home or in the office, to enhance a sense of ownership and comfort.
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish hybrid policies and protocols: doing so ensures fairness, transparency, and accountability for all employees and makes for a positive work culture.
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on collaboration spaces: offering collaborative spaces within the office encourages spontaneous interactions and idea-sharing, fosters a sense of connection among team members and boosts productivity. A definite win-win.</span></li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It can feel like time stops in January and February, the deep winter months seemingly signalling endless days of cold white skies, dark days and long nights. It’s easy to get in a rut and put off the big decisions until the trees start to blossom, but here’s the thing: nature is quietly getting ready for the year ahead, right now &#8211; and so can you!</p>
<p>We always advise our clients and partners to use the start of the year as a time to evaluate their workspace and begin putting plans into motion. In this blog, we’re going to share our Top 5 reasons why. And just to add, the images you’ll see in this blog post are all dream offices we completed recently (in 2023!) for our clients.</p>
<h2>1. It sets the bar for success</h2>
<p>The month of January represents new beginnings and a chance to start afresh. By embarking on an office redesign or relocation project now, companies can set about aligning their physical workspace with their culture, values and overall vision, from the get-go, setting the tone for success in the year ahead.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-133356" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1.jpg" alt="Workspace interior design with bar stools" width="1079" height="720" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1.jpg 1000w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1079px) 100vw, 1079px" /></p>
<h2>2. It makes you act on last year’s growth and success</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end of the year is a natural time to reflect on business growth and accomplishments. And if your company enjoyed significant growth or underwent changes in 2023, now is a really good time to check if your office space is up to the task. A workplace redesign or relocation can accommodate your evolving needs, whether it&#8217;s expanding your team, creating collaborative spaces, or incorporating new technologies. It&#8217;s a chance to align your office environment with your current and future business objectives.</span></p>
<h2>3. It’s a chance to capitalize on tax benefits</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In New York State, businesses may be eligible for tax incentives and benefits when undertaking office redesign or relocation projects. Firing into action in January and February, rather than leaving it until spring, presents a great opportunity to explore these incentives and leverage them early to reduce costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our in-house experts can help you navigate the complexities of tax benefits in order to maximize your savings as part of our service (along with creating a workplace you’ll love).</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-133789" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shared-work-desks-and-stools-.jpg" alt="A communal workspace with a shared desk setup" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shared-work-desks-and-stools-.jpg 1080w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shared-work-desks-and-stools--300x200.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shared-work-desks-and-stools--1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shared-work-desks-and-stools--768x512.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shared-work-desks-and-stools--700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<h2>4. It minimizes disruption and downtime</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning an office redesign or relocation requires careful coordination and execution. By taking advantage of this refreshing period at the beginning of the year, you can avoid potential disruptions during peak business seasons. Proper planning and project management will ensure a much smoother transition.</span></p>
<h2>5. It shows you’re serious about staying ahead of the curve</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s ultra-competitive business landscape, staying ahead is crucial. An office redesign or relocation can give your business a competitive edge by creating a modern and innovative workspace. This in turn sends a powerful message to clients, partners, employees and new talent. It says your business is forward-thinking and committed to providing the best environment. By investing in your office space, you demonstrate your dedication to employee happiness &#8211; our favourite key driver in a business’s growth and success.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-132075" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1.jpg" alt="Modern office and receptionist area at ESTI" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1.jpg 1136w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1-700x466.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<h2><b>Our final word on the subject…</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the new year unfolds, businesses in New York City and the surrounding suburbs have a unique opportunity to kickstart their office redesign or relocation plans and create a workspace that aligns with their goals, accommodates growth, and enhances their team’s happiness and productivity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With decades of experience in the industry, we know this is often easier said than done to those who may have never gone through an office renovation before. This is why we’ll be sharing a series of ‘How-to’ articles in the coming months, detailing all the ins and outs of the office renovation or relocation process. From navigating rapid company expansion to negotiating an advantageous corporate lease, be on the lookout for our advice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, if you know you&#8217;re ready to start the office redesign or relocation journey, </span><a href="https://riworkplace.com/contact/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">get in touch with our design and build experts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As 2023 draws to a close, we’re looking back at our top 5 company highlights of the year. Without further ado, let’s dive right in…</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-133729" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Image-1.png" alt="" width="1080" height="510" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Image-1.png 1840w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Image-1-300x142.png 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Image-1-1024x483.png 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Image-1-768x362.png 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Image-1-1536x725.png 1536w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Image-1-700x330.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<h2>1. Launching RI Workplace Retreat</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At RI Workplace, our MO has always been driving tangible results for our clients&#8217; businesses through excellent design-build solutions. At the beginning of 2023, we wanted to take these ethos even further. We decided to take an even deeper dive into all the ways we could relieve our clients’ practical concerns, financial burdens, and logistical headaches in their pursuit of the perfect workplace.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133730" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/RI-Group-19.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="718" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/RI-Group-19.jpg 1080w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/RI-Group-19-300x199.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/RI-Group-19-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/RI-Group-19-768x511.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/RI-Group-19-700x465.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p>One of the staggering facts we uncovered during our research period was that 90%+ of global CEOs wanted their workforces back in the office for at least part of the week &#8211; while less than 50% of employees wanted to go back. We realized the challenges facing CEOs ran deep and included:</p>
<p>· Attracting staff back to the office<br />
· Employee retention, engagement and productivity<br />
· Acquisition of new top talent<br />
· Strong economic headwinds<br />
· Increasing lease/real estate prices<br />
· Rising inflation<br />
· Shrinking budgets</p>
<p>This then led us on to exploring the nitty gritty of employees’ needs and wants. In 2023, employees wanted and expected more from their work life and workplace than ever before. They wanted spaces that catered to their unique workstyles and well-being. Spaces as good, if not better, than the home office they made for themselves.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-127444" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sample-library.jpg" alt="Sample Library" width="1080" height="947" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sample-library.jpg 1222w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sample-library-300x263.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sample-library-1024x898.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sample-library-768x674.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sample-library-700x614.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In real terms, this looked like an abundance of next-level amenities, such as quiet tech-free zones, innovation hubs, collaborative spaces, focus rooms, rest areas, outdoor spaces, and meditation zones. Workers who’d designed their own home offices around these concepts weren’t ready to give up these luxuries to return to the office. And CEOs were paying the price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless hours of further fact-finding, research, brainstorming and round-table discussions led us to the development of our brand-new design-build service, Workplace Retreat.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-127336" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RI-Group-Office-17-1.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="718" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RI-Group-Office-17-1.jpg 973w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RI-Group-Office-17-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RI-Group-Office-17-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RI-Group-Office-17-1-700x465.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p>A Workplace Retreat-designed office is the antidote to the real-world challenges faced by CEOs and the kind of space that employees dream of. Where’s the catch, you might ask? There isn’t one. Workplace Retreat delivers a timely, cost-effective, profit-boosting, and fully customized solution. A service that aligns with the needs of the employer &#8211; their space, timeline and budget &#8211; and the wants of employees.</p>
<p>A Workplace Retreat designed office is created to help employers overcome their challenges and deliver multi-layered, multi-area, multi-sensory spaces to every personality in the workspace. While creating a space that would make *every* employee happy and productive was a pipe dream to many employers, our Workplace Retreat design concept proved it was possible. The challenges that once burdened CEOs became opportunities for success with Workplace Retreat &#8211; and we’re really proud of having discovered the secret sauce!</p>

<h2>2. Embellishing the employee experience at ESTI Warehouse</h2>
<p>Our client ESTI Warehouse has a strong desire to lead the pack when it comes to delivering employee wellbeing. They came to us saying they wanted to attract and retain top talent and wanted a workspace that reflected this ambition.</p>
<p>We’re proud to say we delivered their dream office. What did the project look like? We delivered an industrial loft-style scheme that’s contemporary and fresh, and aligns perfectly with their industry. Blackened steel framed glass walls, open deck ceiling, authentic brick feature walls, polished concrete floors, and Iron Age furniture were all brought in to create ESTI’s very own Workplace Retreat. In the words of our client, “We’re super happy with the complete project. We spend more time at work than home and you have created a work environment that all our employees are very proud of.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-133732" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/KDLM-10.jpg" alt="Lawyers Office " width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/KDLM-10.jpg 1080w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/KDLM-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/KDLM-10-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/KDLM-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/KDLM-10-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<h2>3. Saving money for a leading New York law firm, KDLM</h2>
<p>We were thrilled to create a new office environment for Manhattan legal firm, KDLM. Along with delivering enhanced aesthetics and storage &#8211; and a fresh blend of collaborative and confidential spaces within the office &#8211; we were also proud to have saved the company a raft of future spendings. By creating new spaces within the existing office for the company to host events and meetings, we supported them to eliminate the ongoing costs they’d been laying out on the rental of external event spaces.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133733" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Power-Pak-24.jpg" alt="Modern Kitchen in the workplace" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Power-Pak-24.jpg 1080w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Power-Pak-24-300x200.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Power-Pak-24-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Power-Pak-24-768x512.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Power-Pak-24-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<h2>4. Expanding PowerPak’s offices without disrupting their day-to-day operations</h2>
<p>PowerPak Civil &amp; Safety, the USA’s leading source for utility and infrastructure supplies came to us when they outgrew their office. Their team was growing every day and they wanted a new space with a “wow” factor. However, they also needed us to achieve this while their office space was occupied.</p>
<p>Moving staff to a new location while work got underway was not an option. And so we set to work. We delivered an open loft style space with high ceilings, lots of wood, high bay lighting and an orange color scheme to match the firm’s branding. We also made space for a mezzanine breakout area that overlooks a stunning 30-foot high wall mural of the New York City skyline. That the company was awarded the ‘2023 Great Place to Work award’ &#8211; meaning 90%+ of the company’s employees love working there compared to the 57% US average &#8211; said it all for us!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133735" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/office-reception.jpg" alt="Office Reception with custom lighting" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/office-reception.jpg 1080w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/office-reception-300x200.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/office-reception-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/office-reception-768x512.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/office-reception-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<h2>5. Creating a space for Tweezerman where their team feel valued</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tweezerman International, LLC wanted to revamp their large outdated corporate office space in Port Washington, NY to better align with their sleek and clean image and to house their growing team. They asked us to address their existing workplace inefficiencies and create a space that would ‘make their employees feel their very best’. Light, bright, sleek, flexible were our design keywords. And the team loved the results. “Our new office space includes more casual workspaces along with increased natural light and modern collaboration areas equipped with state-of-the-art technology,” said the company’s CEO. “We are delighted to be part of a company that continually strives to be the best place to work.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion</span></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For us, every project we work on is an opportunity to create a space that not only embodies the business’s brand but also delivers something unique &#8211; a one-off design feature that says ‘Hello. This is who we are’!<br />
We love working with our clients to push the boundaries of traditional office design and incorporate features that make a statement. Not only because such features capture the attention of visitors and potential new talent, but because &#8211; and we know this first-hand &#8211; they also make for a space that boosts wellbeing, creativity, collaboration, and productivity amongst the existing team.<br />
We’ve been taking a look back at some of our favorite projects and created a shortlist of eight of our favorite design elements that combine creativity with functionality.</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133375" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zigzag-lighting.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zigzag-lighting.jpg 1080w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zigzag-lighting-300x200.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zigzag-lighting-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zigzag-lighting-768x512.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zigzag-lighting-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<h2><b>1. Union County Savings Bank’s zig-zag light feature</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RI Workplace’s Design Director, Komel Saeed explains: “I designed a zigzag light because Union County Savings Bank (UCSB) has a star in their logo that has the same angle degree as the zigzag we designed for the conference room ceiling. I always try to incorporate the brand identity in the design and this was a subtle way of doing it.”</p>
<p>2.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133376" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Textured-walls-in-lobby.jpg" alt="Office lobby with textured feature walls" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Textured-walls-in-lobby.jpg 1080w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Textured-walls-in-lobby-300x200.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Textured-walls-in-lobby-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Textured-walls-in-lobby-768x512.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Textured-walls-in-lobby-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<h2><b>2. Tweezerman HQ’s textured wall</b></h2>
<p>This custom feature wall adds depth and a sense of movement and character to the reception area of the tweezer giant’s corporate office space in Port Washington, NY. It’s a subtle but statement point of difference that elevates the space’s ambiance and sets a unique tone.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133378" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Full-Wall-Mural.jpg" alt="Office with a Mural that is full wall size " width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Full-Wall-Mural.jpg 1080w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Full-Wall-Mural-300x200.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Full-Wall-Mural-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Full-Wall-Mural-768x512.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Full-Wall-Mural-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<h2><b>3. PowerPak’s 30-ft NYC mural</b></h2>
<p>At PowerPak, we created a standout 30-foot mural of the Manhattan skyline &#8211; bringing the buzz, energy and industry of the Big Apple to the New York construction company’s corporate offices.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-133359" src="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KDLM_12.jpg" alt="Lounge area in New York City law firm that was recently renovated" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KDLM_12.jpg 1000w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KDLM_12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KDLM_12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://riworkplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/KDLM_12-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h2><b>4. KDLM law firm’s unique blend of tradition and modernity </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RI Workplace’s Design Director, Komel explains: “KDLM is a prestigious law firm that wanted to modernize their office while still maintaining the integrity and seriousness of the business. The design features we chose were aesthetically pleasing and functional. For example we opened all the ceilings to give a nice open look but dropped felt panels so they could absorb sound and break up the large open white ceiling deck. I would describe the overall design as ‘soft luxury’. The light fixtures were especially my favorite to design.”</span></p>

<h2><b>5. Marotta Controls’ plant and artwork wall </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branding extends beyond logos &#8211; it permeates every aspect of a workspace. At Marotta Controls &#8211;  a firm specializing in the global security and aerospace sector &#8211; we incorporated a plant and artwork wall that not only brings the outside world in, but also reinforces the company’s identity and commitment to a healthy environment.</span></p>

<h2><b>6. ESTI Warehouse’s exposed brick wall and industrial styling</b></h2>
<p>RI Workplace Project Administrator, Wendy Macdonald says: “The client chose to have an exposed brick wall after seeing a similar installation in our own showroom. They liked that it was an authentic way to bring an industrial feel to their corporate offices while preserving the down-to-earth warmth of their tire brand.”</p>
<p>“We were also able to achieve the client’s furniture vision. We hadn’t previously worked with their preferred brand but we were able to accommodate this and purchase the exact products they were looking for. Our ability to partner with a vast majority of furniture manufacturers means we can carefully customize solutions for each client’s desires.”</p>

<h2><b>7. Coulmed and Phoenix’s custom collaboration-hives: </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hive is a wood-enclosed hangout designed to accommodate 2-6 people &#8211; ideal for confidential conversations and casual meetings that don’t require a boardroom set-up but which also promote open and transparent communication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We created custom collaboration hives at surgical supplies company, Coulmed, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fragrance manufacturer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phoenix &#8211; both pictured above. We love collaboration hives so much we installed them at our own workplace in Saddle Brook, NJ, too (pictured below). With integrated technology and power points, they deliver the perfect blend of privacy and connectivity.</span></p>

<b>8. Samples Library at RI Workplace</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our own office transformation showcases our commitment to innovation. We went from inhabiting a nondescript blank canvas (when we moved into our new space in 2020) to a workplace that seamlessly meshes together all of our favorite design ideas. One of these ideas was our ‘Samples library’ where clients can explore our samples-catalogues and design literature to feel inspired. There are comfy chairs to relax in, and a ‘bar top’ and stools to read at and enjoy a coffee too.</span></p>
<h2><b>In summary</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At RI Workplace, we believe that exceptional design can be found in the details as well as in the wider space. For us, it’s about creating environments that inhale and exhale the unique culture, characters and ambitions of a company. We like to think our projects are a testament to our passion for creativity &#8211; and we hope you do too.</span></p>
