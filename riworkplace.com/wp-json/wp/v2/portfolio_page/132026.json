This meant addressing the needs of a dynamic mix of age groups and personality types while maintaining a strong focus on the firm&#8217;s hallmark of dedication to client satisfaction. As the most successful and respected trial attorneys in the country, their outdated office could no longer sufficiently meet their needs.<\/p>\n<h3>Solution:<\/h3>\n<p>Handling paper documentation is an essential part of KDLM\u2019s day-to-day operations so storage and filing capacity was tripled in the new space. Personal storage space was included at each desk and special attention was paid to desk layout and orientation to accommodate each employee\u2019s particular way of working. Multiple chairs were trialed to ensure the most practical and comfortable selection was made for staff in each department. A critical part of KDLM\u2019s process is face-to-face meetings with clients experiencing extraordinary pressure in their lives. A bright and cheery conference room was built right at the entrance of the space to serve as a homey area where clients could easily come and be well looked after. Instead of a repetitive \u201crun-of-the-mill\u201d design for the Managing Partners\u2019 offices, colors, finishes, furniture and millwork were meticulously customized to each of their personal tastes. Desks were positioned to take advantage of natural daylight and to maximize views of the Oculus and 9\/11 Memorial Pools. A beautiful and spacious caf\u00e9 was incorporated to provide an ideal area for KDLM to host their important gatherings with government officials and other honorable guests. Decorative acoustical baffles, glass office fronts, modern lighting and a charming reception area on both the 5th and 10th floors were carefully thought out to create a state-of-the-art office aligned with the firm\u2019s success.<\/p>\n<h3>Results:<\/h3>\n<p>KDLM is proud to have a warm welcoming atmosphere where clients can come and feel at ease in spite of facing stressful legal processes. Employees love the new upbeat design because it portrays positive energy and makes them feel like the daily commute to the office is truly worthwhile. They are able to work more efficiently due to the well-thought out space planning and furniture layout. The managing partners are enjoying their spacious personalized offices as a \u201chome away from home\u201d. In the words of the client, \u201cWorking closely with you on this project was a blast. As you can imagine, it meant a great deal to me that we were successful in this endeavor.\u201d RI Workplace is pleased to have designed and delivered this successful endeavor for the \u201cBest Lawyers\u201d in America.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/aptook0PYIg\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block;
